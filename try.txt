Prisma is an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool that helps you interact with your database. It does not provide functionality for uploading files such as pictures and videos. To upload pictures and videos, you can use a cloud storage service like Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Cloudinary. These services provide APIs for uploading and managing files.

Here is an example of how you can upload a picture to Amazon S3 using the aws-sdk library in Node.js:

import AWS from 'aws-sdk';

const s3 = new AWS.S3({
  accessKeyId: process.env.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID,
  secretAccessKey: process.env.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
});

const uploadPicture = async (file: Buffer, fileName: string) => {
  const params = {
    Bucket: process.env.AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME,
    Key: fileName,
    Body: file,
    ContentType: 'image/jpeg',
    ACL: 'public-read'
  };

  try {
    const result = await s3.upload(params).promise();
    return result.Location;
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
    throw new Error('Failed to upload picture');
  }
};
This code creates an instance of the S3 class from the aws-sdk library and uses it to upload a picture to an S3 bucket. The uploadPicture function takes a file buffer and a fileName string as arguments and returns the URL of the uploaded picture.

After uploading the pictures and videos to the cloud storage service, you can store the URLs of the uploaded files in your database using Prisma. For example:

import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';

const prisma = new PrismaClient();

const createPost = async (title: string, content: string, pictures: string[], videos: string[]) => {
  const post = await prisma.post.create({
    data: {
      title,
      content,
      pictures,
      videos
    }
  });
  return post;
};
This code uses the create method of the Prisma post model to create a new post with the given title, content, pictures, and videos. The pictures and videos arguments are arrays of URLs of the uploaded pictures and videos.
